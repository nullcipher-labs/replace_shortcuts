# replace_shortcuts
a little scripts that replaces all shortcuts (windows) in a directory (and its sub directories) with copies of the files each shortcut is pointing to (deletes the shortcuts themselves)
the path of the target directory can be changed at the top of the code, in the "DIR" variable.
